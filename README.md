# TeamsOCR
AutoTeamsOCR is a Python project designed to automatically capture screenshots of the Microsoft Teams window during online meetings, crop the images using OpenCV, and extract text using pytesseract for optical character recognition (OCR).

## Working

AutoTeamsOCR will automatically read from screenshots taken by the user.

Each screenshot will be cropped to include only the relevant area and then processed using OCR to extract the text.

The extracted text will be stored locally.
